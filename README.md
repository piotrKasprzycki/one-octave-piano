#  One Octave Piano

This is a simple one octave piano web app that I have created for the purpose of learning. 
The goal of this project was to practice web development skills, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
## Features

- Virtual keyboard: A virtual keyboard that simulates the real-life piano keyboard. You can play the piano using your computer keyboard [Z, S, X, D, C, V, G, B, H, N, J, M] or by clicking on the keys of the virtual keyboard.
